<b>Hexxorscii</b>

I've encountered multiple instances during CTFs that require hex values to be XORed with another hex value, and then converted into an ascii string to form a flag or a necessary part to obtain a flag. 

This quick and easy script will function to do this based on whatever values you give it.
